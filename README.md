# Daramola Olasupo — Original Systems for Ethical Tech

I design secure, human-centered digital infrastructures at the intersection of:
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity** (offensive/defensive simulation, zero-trust labs)
- 🤖 **AI Governance** (risk forecasting, smart contract auditing)
- ⛓️ **Web3 Resilience** (decentralized identity, DeFi security)

## Core Projects
- **CYBERCRUX OS**: 12-module Rust-based cybersecurity lab (<100ms latency)
- **AI Risk Simulation Framework**: ML engine for DeFi vulnerability detection
- **Muchie**: Ethical offensive security CLI (in development)
- **AfriShield Finance**: AI-powered DeFi gateway for African MSMEs

All work is product-led, self-developed, and aligned with principles of **responsible innovation**.
